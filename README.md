# VelocityAutoBackup
is a comprehensive plugin for the Velocity proxy server, designed to provide a fully automated, flexible, and secure backup solution. With direct integration into Google Drive, this plugin ensures all your critical server data is stored safely off-site and is accessible at any time.

This plugin is specifically designed to work with personal Google accounts, utilizing a unique authorization flow to bypass common technical limitations.

### ‚ú® Key Features
**_Flexible Scheduling_** ‚è∞: Configure multiple backup times within a single day through the config.yml. You can schedule backups to run twice, three times, or as often as you need, complete with timezone settings for precise scheduling.

**_Instant Manual Backups_** ‚ö°: With the /backup-now command, administrators can trigger a full backup process at any moment without waiting for the schedule. This feature is perfect before performing maintenance or significant server changes.

**_Dynamic File Naming_** üìù: Take full control of your backup file naming. Use placeholders like {server_name} and {timestamp} with a customizable date format (e.g., yyyy-M-d--HH-mm) to produce organized and easily searchable filename.

**_Full Google Drive Integration_** ‚òÅÔ∏è: Backups, compressed into a .zip format, are automatically uploaded to a specific folder in your Google Drive. The plugin supports the use of a personal Google account after completing a secure, one-time authorization process.

**_Reliable Anti-Loop Logic_** üõ°Ô∏è: Built with a smart mechanism to automatically exclude its own directory from the backup process, preventing "backup loop" issues that can cause file sizes to grow uncontrollably.
